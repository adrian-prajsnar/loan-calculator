# Loan Calculator

## Description

This is a Node.js application for calculating and updating loan status. The project provides an API endpoint to handle loan-related calculations, including updating installment amounts based on a reference rate and notifying users of invalid inputs. This project is dockerized and utilizes a MySQL database.

**Features:**

-   Calculate updated loan installment amounts and remaining loan balance based on the fetched reference rate.
-   Check for invalid inputs (e.g., zero or negative installment amount) and notify users via email.
-   Compare the userâ€™s interest rate with a reference rate and provide feedback if the interest rate is higher.
-   Save calculation results and reference rate data to a MySQL database.
-   Dockerized setup for easy deployment.
